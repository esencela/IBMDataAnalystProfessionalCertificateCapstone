# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project

This repository contains my capstone project for the **IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate**.  
The project demonstrates end-to-end data analysis skills, including data wrangling, visualization, and reporting.  

The deliverables include:
- Dashboard built in IBM Cognos Analytics
- Final Report with insights and recommendations


The goal of this project was to apply the data analysis lifecycle to a real-world dataset.  
The steps included:
1. **Data Collection** – Gathering raw datasets from public sources.  
2. **Data Wrangling & Cleaning** – Handling missing values, formatting, and preparing data for analysis.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Identifying patterns, trends, and outliers.  
4. **Visualization** – Creating an interactive dashboard with IBM Cognos Analytics.  
5. **Reporting** – Presenting findings and insights in a professional slideshow report.


## Dashboard (IBM Cognos Analytics)

The interactive dashboard provides visual insights into the dataset, including:  
- Trend analysis of developer tools
- Demographic breakdowns
  

## Final Report

The final slideshow report (in PDF format) summarizes the analysis, findings, and recommendations. 


## Tools & Technologies

- **IBM Cognos Analytics** – Dashboard creation  
- **Jupyter Notebook / Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** – Data preparation & analysis  
- **Excel / SQL** – Data wrangling & queries  
- **PowerPoint / PDF** – Final reporting
  

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- Data Wrangling & Cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis  
- Data Visualization & Dashboarding  
- Storytelling with Data  
- Business Insights & Recommendations
